# here is some helpful documentation: https://www.interviewcake.com/concept/java/hash-map
# has maps are really similar to arrays, but instead of number indicies, hash maps can create their own
# to avoid hash collisions, the array value can hold a pointer to a linked list

# def __init__(self) - set the size of the array
# def get_hash(self, key) - takes a key and generates an appropriate index to assign that key
# def add(self, key, value) - adds a value to a key (calls the get_hash function)
# def get(self, key) - gets a value (or values?) - calls get_hash
# def delete(self, key) - delete a key 
# def keys(self) - list all the keys
